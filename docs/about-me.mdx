  <div className="about-content">
    <p>I am Cristian Romagnoli, a Senior Web Engineer based in Argentina with 16+ years of experience building and evolving large-scale frontend systems across retail, media, marketplaces, and enterprise products.</p>

    <p>I am currently <CurrentAge /> years old. I work in both Spanish and English environments.</p>

    <p>I have a design-driven background and a strong focus on high-quality React solutions for complex, large-scale web applications. Across the full application lifecycle, I contribute to client-side implementation and server-adjacent logic with emphasis on architecture, performance, maintainability, and long-term product sustainability.</p>

    <p>I strongly prefer functional programming principles, using immutability, composability, and declarative patterns to build predictable, scalable, and testable systems. I am analytical and detail-driven, with a proactive approach to complex problem solving in high-constraint environments with evolving requirements.</p>

    <p>I actively leverage AI-assisted development and prompt engineering as a productivity and quality multiplier for design, implementation, and technical decision-making.</p>

    <p>Outside work, I’ve trained in swimming since childhood, and I also enjoy aviation, cars, architecture, and hands-on DIY projects at home. I also enjoy mate (traditional Argentine herbal infusion) and craft beer.</p>
