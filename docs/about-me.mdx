  <div className="about-content">
    <p>I am Cristian Romagnoli, a Senior Web Engineer based in Argentina with 16+ years of experience building and evolving large-scale frontend systems across retail, media, marketplaces, and enterprise products.</p>

    <p>I am currently <CurrentAge /> years old. I work in both Spanish and English environments.</p>

    <p>My core focus is React architecture and resilient product delivery, with frequent ownership of server-adjacent runtime integration code across key product flows.</p>

    <p>Outside work, I train in swimming (since I was a little kid), and I also enjoy aviation, architecture, cars, and hands-on DIY projects at home. I also enjoy mate and craft beer.</p>
