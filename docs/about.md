# About

I’m a senior web engineer with 16+ years of experience building and evolving large-scale web applications across retail, media, marketplaces, and enterprise environments.

My work has focused on designing and delivering high-quality React-based frontend systems within complex ecosystems — often involving legacy constraints and progressive modernization strategies.

I value pragmatic engineering, clarity in system design, and long-term sustainability over short-term optimizations.
