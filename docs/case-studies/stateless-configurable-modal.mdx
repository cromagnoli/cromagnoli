# Stateless Configurable Modal

:::info Core Objective
Normalize a cross-company edit-product modal pattern behind one reusable API without removing team-level flexibility.

:::note Transparency Disclaimer
The documentation scaffolding and page implementation were generated with AI assistance and should not be evaluated as original authored product code.
The authored case-study implementation code resides in the case-study source under `src/components/stateless-product-edit-modal`.
All architecture and source-code excerpts shown in this case study are from my authored implementation under the path above.

This case study is organized into focused demo pages to reduce page weight and improve evaluation clarity; each page includes a live code editor to validate the public API, extensibility model, and behavioral variants in real time.

## Architectural Rationale

### Problem To Solve

At company scale, multiple teams had built near-identical edit-product modals with diverging visuals and behavior. This created duplicated logic, inconsistent UX, and high maintenance cost.

The goal was to normalize this cross-cutting pattern behind one reusable modal API, while preserving team-level flexibility for business rules and presentation.

That is why this modal exposes a configurable render-prop surface and composable partials instead of a rigid fixed layout.

:::note Why it matters
One API reduced duplicated modal logic across teams while still allowing business-specific UX differences through controlled extension points.
:::

### Approach Taken

This implementation exposes:

- composable partial UI components/utilities for consumers
- render props with rich derived args for runtime composition

instead of only fixed slots with opaque internals.

### Why This Is A Sound Tradeoff

- Higher extensibility without forking modal internals
- Reuse of domain-derived state (`currentMatchingSku`, maps, indexes) at integration points
- Better fit for experimentation and business-specific behavior

Tradeoff:

- API surface is larger and requires stronger documentation discipline.
