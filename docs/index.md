# Production-Proven Case Studies

This portfolio documents production systems shipped under real-world constraints.

## What You'll Find Here

1. Real migration and scaling patterns used in production-like conditions.
2. Architecture-first write-ups focused on decision quality, not UI polish.
3. Interactive demos that let you validate behavior, fallback paths, and runtime boundaries.

## Case Studies Index

1. [Progressive Rollout from Legacy to NextGen Stack (Hybrid Routing)](/cromagnoli/case-studies/progressive-rollout-legacy)  
   Dual-runtime route resolution, rollback controls, and resilience patterns for incremental modernization.
2. [Stateless Configurable Modal](/cromagnoli/case-studies/stateless-configurable-modal)  
   Production-grade configurable modal architecture with resolver patterns and reusable render contracts.
3. [Stateless Configurable Modal API](/cromagnoli/case-studies/stateless-configurable-modal-api)  
   Public API surface, extension points, and implementation contracts for consumers.

## How To Read These Docs

1. `Summary`: Understand the problem and target outcome quickly.
2. `Key Files`: Inspect the core implementation surfaces and contracts.
3. `Resilience`: Validate failure handling and rollback strategy.
4. `Live Demo`: Confirm behavior interactively.

## What This Demonstrates

Each case is structured to evaluate:

1. Architecture quality and boundaries.
2. Tradeoff clarity under delivery constraints.
3. Operability (debuggability, fallback, controlled rollout).
4. Resiliency under failure conditions.
